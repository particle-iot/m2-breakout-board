1.Remove 3.3v power LED  cutable trace
2.repair CS PIN  misstake PIN because of featherwing error silkcreen 
3.Reserve 2 pinholes for jumpers ，GPIO0  is used for IRQ ADC7   is used for RESET 
4.Remove power module EN, PG connections to MSOM and  featherwing
change  for test:

1.3V3 is divided into one channel as the load conversion switch 3V3_AUX, and GPIO1 is added to control EN_AUX
2. Change the peripheral power supply to load 3V3_AUX
3. Remove LED2 (required by nick)
4.LED1 only lights up when DC_JACK, add NMOS control
5. Modify the TS pin configuration and add reserved plug-in resistor vacancies.
6.J10 exchanges the positions of PWM1 and PWM2 and aligns with pinmap
7. modify the layout
8.change the reset PIN of featherWing

1. Change feather jumpers to smd scratch pads
2. Align proto area with m.2
3. Add 3.3V and GND rail along the proto area
4. LiPo battery pinout change - when we changed from vertical to horizontal, the pinout was flipped. so this is now fixed.
5. Flipped the TX/RX to match the feather pin out
6. Removed EN pin connection to feather
7. Align RGB LED and buttons
8. Align the mounting holes to the corners of the PCB
9. Updated silkscreen and pinout labels on top and bottom

4/11
1.Removed the TP test pad bottom
2.Add  GND polygon for lay2
3.Add tracker code
4.remove J22
5.modify featherwing the D3/CTS instead GPIO1
6.add RGB silkscreen
