1.3V3 is divided into one channel as the load conversion switch 3V3_AUX, and GPIO1 is added to control EN_AUX
2. Change the peripheral power supply to load 3V3_AUX
3. Remove LED2 (required by nick)
4.LED1 only lights up when DC_JACK, add NMOS control
5. Modify the TS pin configuration and add reserved plug-in resistor vacancies.
6.J10 exchanges the positions of PWM1 and PWM2 and aligns with pinmap
7. modify the layout
