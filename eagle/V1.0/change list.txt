1.Remove 3.3v power LED  cutable trace
2.repair CS PIN  misstake PIN because of featherwing error silkcreen 
3.Reserve 2 pinholes for jumpers ，GPIO0  is used for IRQ ADC7   is used for RESET 
4.Remove power module EN, PG connections to MSOM and  featherwing
change  for test:

1.3V3 is divided into one channel as the load conversion switch 3V3_AUX, and GPIO1 is added to control EN_AUX
2. Change the peripheral power supply to load 3V3_AUX
3. Remove LED2 (required by nick)
4.LED1 only lights up when DC_JACK, add NMOS control
5. Modify the TS pin configuration and add reserved plug-in resistor vacancies.
6.J10 exchanges the positions of PWM1 and PWM2 and aligns with pinmap
7. modify the layout
8.change the reset PIN of featherWing

1. Change feather jumpers to smd scratch pads
2. Align proto area with m.2
3. Add 3.3V and GND rail along the proto area
4. LiPo battery pinout change - when we changed from vertical to horizontal, the pinout was flipped. so this is now fixed.
5. Flipped the TX/RX to match the feather pin out
6. Removed EN pin connection to feather
7. Align RGB LED and buttons
8. Align the mounting holes to the corners of the PCB
9. Updated silkscreen and pinout labels on top and bottom

4/11
1.Removed the TP test pad bottom
2.Add  GND polygon for lay2
3.Add tracker code
4.remove J22
5.modify featherwing the D3/CTS instead GPIO1
6.add RGB silkscreen

4/19
1.Repair the silk screen to the jumper,change the size of the circle at the position of the small rubber pad
2.Remove the jumper from LED1 to 3V3,R16/NC,R17/NC.R11/NC, R22 as 0R ,make the circuit simple that used DC power supply directly  control, change the  Q1  as nmos and NC reserved
3.Optimize SPI traces to make them equal in length

4/24
1.change V0.3 as v0.4
2.change the power module footprint  so that the bottom can be soldered with connector, and the top layer can be directly SMT on the breakout board

Schematic
1.change D4 from TVS to ESD,but DNP.
2.Modify DC power switch circuit, add Q2,add R32 1K 0402,change R15 from 1K to 36K,change R14 from 100K to 62K.
3.Remove MFF2 eSIM circuit.
4.Remove the EEPROM circuit.
5.Add new package tactile switch S2,S3.
6.Remove SIM card circuit.

PCB
1.change R30 PCB package.
2.Remove data silkscreen.
3.The bottom side of the board below the power module add silkscreen:"Insert on Top Side".
4.The top side of the power module add silkscreen:“Power Module - Insert This Side”.
5.The top side of the power module, add thermal PAD. 
6.The pin 1 of the power module add silkscreen:1
7.The SMA ports add silkscreen SMA1 to SMA3.
8.Change J6 PCB package,change drill from 1.016mm to 1.3mm. Smaller pad 0.5mm.
9.Add silkscreen label on the PCB to note that USB is only for comms and not power--"DATA ONLY"
10.Add 3V3_AUX LED.
11.Change PCB version to V1.0.
